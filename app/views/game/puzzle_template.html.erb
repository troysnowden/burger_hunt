    <p>You run into your old pal Rufus. This guy loves to talk and you really don't have time for his
    nonsense right now. After exchanging pleasantries for what felt like an eternity you try to squeeze
    past him but he not so subtly blocks your way.</p>

    <p><i>'I'll let you on your way if you can solve this riddle'</i></p>

    <p>Reluctantly you agree.</p>

    <p>'Well done, here's your reward'. He passes you a carrot for some inexplicable reason.</p>
    <p><i>'I'll let you on your way, but be warned that the path ahead is a treacherous one'</i></p>
    <p>You wonder what he's talking about, because the path ahead has been rated 5th in the 'Top 20 most pleasant walks in <%= @city_name %>'.
    Actually, Rufus is probably right, now that you think about it.</p>
    <p>You decide to carry on anyway.</p>
